# README

This is a small script and convenience wrapper around some of the functionality in [`notion-py`](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py).  Its intent is to serialize Notion tables to CSV files.

Usage syntax is available _via_ `notion2csv.py -h`:
usage: notion2csv.py [-h] TOKEN_V2 URL PATH

```text
Generate a CSV file from a Notion table

positional arguments:
  TOKEN_V2    API token_v2, via logged-in notion.so cookies
  URL         URL of the table to convert
  PATH        Output path for CSV

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Currently, this is used as part of the PBLL project to serialize project story artifacts â†” standard mappings to a CSV file suitable and reflects the structure of that as reflected in [this mock table](https://www.notion.so/powderhousepbll/7f9e7bb5fafe4df2bcd3bbcf2baf7348?v=07e6604a555543d6adffcf48257988ab), _i.e_.
